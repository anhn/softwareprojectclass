        1. Create a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.  
        2. Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess the number. The program should provide feedback to the user (e.g. 'Too high' or 'Too low') until the correct number is guessed.
